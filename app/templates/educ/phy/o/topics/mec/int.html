            <p>
                Light is a form of energy which is responsible for the sense of sight. Light belongs to a family of
                electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves do not need a medium fro their transmission hence light
                can travel
                through a vacuum and the speed of light in a vacuum is 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> ms<sup>-1</sup>.

                <p>
                    An object is only seen if light reflected from the object enters our eyes. Most of the objects do
                    not make their
                    own light but reflect light from other sources to our eyes. The following are sources of light;

                        <h5>Luminous Objects</h5>
                        <p>
                            These are objects which produce their own light. Examples are the sun, stars, glow warms,
                            electric bulbs,
                            among others. Some of these luminous objects are natural and others are artificial.

                    <li>
                        <h5>Non-Luminous Objects</h5>
                        <p>
                            These are objects which do not produce their own light. Examples are the moon, the earth,
                            among others.
                            These non-luminous objects just reflect light from other sources and they appear as though,
                            they are
                            producing the light. The moon is the perfect example because it reflects light from the sun
                            to the earth.

                        <p>
                            These are objects which give off light when they are hot. Examples are fire wood, candles,
                            electric filaments,
                            metallic objects, among others. When these objects are burning or when they their
                            temperatures go beyond
                            certain limits, they produce light.

                        <p>
                            These are luminous objects that produce light without being hot. Examples are glow warms,
                            stars, among others.
                            They are naturally occurring objects which do not need heat to produce light.

                            of light later.

                <p>
                    Light travels from its source to another point through a vacuum or a medium. There are three media
                    through
                    which light travels and these are;

                        <p>
                            This the type of medium which allows almost all the light to pass through it and objects
                            are seen
                            clearly. Examples are glass, pure or distilled water, paraffin, among others. Incident
                            light on
                            these media just passes through after being bent to other different angles.

                            This is the type of medium which allows some of the light to pass through it and objects
                            are not
                            seen clearly. These include frosted glass, oily paper, cloudy liquids, among others. Most
                            of the light
                            incident on these media is absorbed and the little that goes through not enough to make the

                            This is the type of medium which does not allow light to pass through it and objects are
                            not seen
                            at all. These media absorb all the light incident on them. Examples are walls, stones,

                A shadow is an area where light cannot reach. Therefore, a shadow is formed when an opaque object

            <h4>Solar Eclipse:</h4>

            <p>
                This occurs when the moon is between the sun and the earth so that both the Umbra and
                the Penumbra reach the Earth. This is because the moon revolves around the Earth, and the
                Earth revolves around the Sun. It is sometimes referred to as the eclipse of the Sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a Solar Eclipse, areas on Earth fall under the moon's shadow and two shadows are formed
                on earth, that is, Umbra which is formed when the moon blocks the Sun completely
                and the Sun is not seen at all and Penumbra which is formed when the moon blocks the Sun
                partly and part of the Sun can be seen. Umbra covers a very small area compared to Penumbra which
                covers a large area hence very many people on Earth experience <b>Partial Eclipse</b> rather
                than <b>Total Eclipse</b> of the Sun. In a solar Eclipse, the area covered by the Umbra has
                total Darkness and the Sun cannot be seen at all, while the areas covered by the Penumbra has
                partial darkness and a part of the Sun can be seen.

                        This occurs when the Moon and the Sun do not come in the same straight line but the Moon
                        partly covers the sun hence the Sun is visible from a large portion of the Earth. In this
                        type of eclipse, the Umbra of the Moon completely misses and therefore no region on Earth
                        will experience total solar eclipse but only part of the Penumbra covers some regions on
                        the Earth.

                        In this type of eclipse, the Moon looks as big as the Sun hence covering the Sun completely
                        and this happens when the Earth and the Moon are closest to each other. Total eclipse is
                        observed by only people in the Umbra region.

                        This occurs when the Sun and the Moon are positioned in one straight line but the Moon does
                        not completely cover the Sun. In this case, the Moon appears smaller than the Sun and a bright
                        ring is visible in the sky. This happens when the Earth is furthest from the Moon so that the
                        Umbra does not reach the earth but only the Penumbra reaches the Earth.

                Total Solar eclipse is a rare event that on an average it would repeat itself only once in about 370
                years. The duration of a Total Eclipse is really very short that it can not last for more than 7
                minutes
                and 30 seconds. This is because, the Moon's Umbra is moving at a speed of about 1,700kmh<sup>-1</sup>
                across the Earth's surface. It is estimated that the longest Solar eclipse will occur on July 16, 2186,
                and will last for a record of 7 minutes and 29 seconds only. One of the longest Solar Eclipse of the
                21<sup>st</sup> century occurred on July 22, 2013, lasting only 6 minutes and 39 seconds.

            <p>
                This occurs when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon. It is sometimes referred to as the <b>Eclipse
                    of
                    the Moon</b>.
                In Lunar Eclipse, the shadow of the Earth is formed on the Moon. Lunar eclipse happens when the Moon
                passes through the Earth's shadow. The Earth always has a shadow created by the Sun and this shadow is
                composed of Two portions, that is, the Penumbra where some portion of Sun's light rays are blocked and
                the
                Umbra where all the Sun's light rays are blocked.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Eclipse of the Moon lasts longer than the Eclipse of the Sun because the earth is larger than
                the Moon in the eclipse of the Sun.

                        enough to block the Sun's light rays. This is some times referred to as a Pulse Eclipse.

                A Pinhole Camera is a simple camera without a lens and with a single small aperture (a pinhole) that is
                a
                light-proof box with a small hole in one side. It consists of a light tight box with a hole on one side
                and
                a screen on the opposite where the image is formed. Light from a scene passes through this single point
                and
                projects an inverted image on the opposite side of the box. When the object is placed in front of a
                pinhole
                camera, light rays from the object passes through the pinhole un-deviated and a real, diminished and
                inverted
                image is formed on the screen at the back of the pinhole camera.

                also
                a thin screen which looks like a projector sheet, and is put in between the ark side adjacent to the
