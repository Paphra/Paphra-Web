				<h3>Maximum and Minimum Pressure</h3>

					The relationship between pressure and surface area is as follows;<br />
					\t The smaller the area of contact, the higher the pressure whereas the larger the area of contact, the lower

				<ul id="listRm">
					<li>
						A nail has a pointed end so that the driving force is applied on a very small surface area hence pressure
						is very high and this makes it to penetrate the material easily.

						An elephant has toes made of flat surface area which makes the pressure o decrease hence exerting a small
						force on the ground.
					</li>
					<li>
						A tractor has very broad wheels and though very heavy, it doesn't sink into the soft ground because of
						the large areas of the wheels which causes the tractor to exert a small pressure on the ground.

			<h3 id="term_atmospheric_presssure">Atmospheric Pressure:</h3>
			<p>
				Atmospheric pressure is the <a href="#pressure" onclick="showDef('pressure')">pressure</a> exerted against the
				surface
				by the weight of the air above that surface. That is the pressure exerted by the wight of the air in the
				atmosphere. If
				the number of air molecules above a surface increases, there are more molecules to exert a force on that surface
				and
				consequently, ,the pressure increases and the reduction in the number of air molecules above a surface
				will result in a decrease in pressure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Atmospheric pressure is measured with an instrument called a <a href="#barometer">"Barometer"</a>, that
				is why atmospheric pressure is also referred to as barometric pressure. On any given planet, low pressure
				areas have less atmospheric mass above their location, where-as high pressure areas have more atmospheric
				mass above their location. Therefore, atmospheric pressure decreases with increase in elevation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The density of air above the earth decreases as the altitude increases leading to the decrease of atmospheric
				pressure at high altitudes. The density of air above the earth increases as the altitude decreases leading to
				high atmospheric pressure at low altitudes.

						<h5>Up-stroke:</h5>
						<p id="lift_up_stroke">
							During the upstroke, when the plunger moves upwards, outlet valve A closes and inlet valve

						</p>
						<h5>Down-stroke:</h5>
						<p id="lift_down_stroke">
							During the down stroke, inlet valve B closes and outlet valve A opens. Water level in the

							<h5>Limitations of a Lift Pump</h5>
							<ul id="listSq">

						</p>
						<h5 id="force_down_stroke">Down-stroke</h5>
						<p>
							During the down stroke, inlet valve B closes and the increase in pressure opens
							the out-let valve A and forces water into the chamber so that as water fills the chamber,
