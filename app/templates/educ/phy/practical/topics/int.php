			    Physics Experiments are largely concerned with the verification of physic laws and determination of constants for-example
			    <b>thermal conductivity of a material, refractive index, acceleration due to gravity</b>. Some experiments are however
			    designed to investigate the relationship between physical quantities. In every case, there is need for accurate use of the <b>apparatus</b> involved
			    in order ti realize the purpose of the experiment.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Physics as a subject of study consists of two parts, that is; the <b>Theory Part</b> and the <b>Practical part</b>.
			    The Theory part involves the study of <a href="/phy/olevel/?t=phy&tp=Law">Physics Laws and principles</a>.
			    The Practical Part on the other hand involves the application of the theory knowledge to <b>practical situations, assessment
				of experimental procedures and observations made</b>. A course in practical Physics is therefore designed to give the students
			    an opportunity of acquiring the skills and techniques in the <b>manipulation of apparatus, the use and understanding of instruments</b> involved.
			    These skills and techniques can easily be acquired by students through regular practice.
			</p>
			<p>
			    It is therefore important for students to do a lot of practice in practical physics. This will also help them to minimize the mistakes
			    that are normally made in the examinations.

					For the Ordinary Level, The Practical exam is divided into three papers, that is Paper Three <b>(535/3)</b>, Paper Four <b>(535/4)</b> and Paper Five <b>(535/5)</b>.
					This is mainly done to allow schools with many numbers of students sitting for the UNEB exams to avoid congestion and allow for the use of enough
					materials during the exam. The candidate is allowed to sit for only <b>one (1) of the papers</b>. This is achieved in a way that, the papers are
					scheduled on different days on the time table. If a student sits for paper 3, then he or she can not sit for paper 4 or 5.

			    The key to success in a physics practical examination and perhaps all other practical examinations is god planning and <a href="http://wikipedia.org/precision" target="_blank">precision</a>.
			    It is therefore advisable for the students to use part of the time allocated for the experiment to plan for their practical answers.
			</p>
			<p>
			    For a good practical answer, the following are important;
			</p>
			<nums>
			    <ul>
				<li>There must be a clear record of experimental results. Marks are given for a clear record of the observations actually made, their
				    suitability, accuracy and the use made of them.</li>
				<li>There is no need for one to copy the procedure [e.g (a), (b), etc].</li>
				<li>Units must be recorded accurately where necessary and written once. Repeat of units is not accepted.</li>
				<li>Neatness and good handwriting are of the essence. Students are advised to carry at least 2 well sharped pencils, at least 2 pens
				    (blue or black), a geometry set and a 30 cm transparent ruler.</li>
				<li>Symbols used in the experiment must be defined (if not defined in the procedures) and well written. <b>Do not</b>
				    change the symbols and case of the letters used in the procedures e.g, m to M, x to X, l to L and vice versa, etc.</li>
				<li>The sources of errors and precautions taken in the experiment should be clearly stated at the end of the experiment if
				    necessary.</li>
