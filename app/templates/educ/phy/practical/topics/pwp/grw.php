		    Graphs are normally used to analyze data obtained from an experiment. The values that you obtain from the process of carrying out
		    an experiment, are usually used in the plotting of a graph that would give the final answer to the in line with the aim of the Experiment.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<h4>Things to Consider for any Question.</h4>
		<div>
		    <h5 id="title">1. Title</h5>
		    <p>
			A graph title describes which Quantity is to be plotted against which Quantity.
			It is obtained from the procedure that Instructs you to <b>Plot a graph of "something" against "something".</b>
			this procedure should be carefully considered because it points at which Quantities to focus on while plotting your graph for the given
			question.
			<br/>Note the Following for any title of any graph;
		    </p>
		    <nums>
			<ul>
			    <li>The graph must have a title clearly written at the top of the Graph Paper.</li>
			    <li>
				<p>
				    The title should be properly written in only one line e.g, <b>A graph of T<sup>2</sup> against x<sup>2</sup>.</b>.
				    <br/>This means that the values of T<sup>2</sup> are to be plotted along the vertical Axis and the Values of x<sup>2</sup>
				    along the Horizontal axis of the Graph.
				</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>The title of the graph must be written as; "<b>A graph of T<sup>2</sup> against x<sup>2</sup></b>", not in any other format.</li>
			    <li>Units of the physical quantities to be plotted against each other must not be included in the title of the graph.</li>
			    <li>
				<p>
				    The title must be written as it is given in the the procedure, i.e. the letters or symbols representing the physical quantities must be written
				    as given in the procedure. <b>Do not capitalize the symbols or Letters if they are given in the small letters and do not make them small letters if the procedure gives you
					capital Letters.</b> If you the opposite, this will mean that you are plotting a totally different graph from the one you are
				    given in the procedure. It is advisable to write your title in small letters keeping the cases for the Letters representing the physical quantities the way
				    they are given to you and only capitalizing the first letter <b>A</b>
				</p>
			    </li>
			</ul>
		    </nums>

		    <h3 id="axes">2. The Axes</h3>
		    <p>
			The axes for any graph must have the following qualities;
		    </p>
		    <div class="row">
			<div class="eight columns">
			    <nums>
				<ul>
				    <li>
					<p>
					    The axes must be drawn perpendicular to each other with arrows to show the direction in which the values are increasing. the type of
					    arrow used should be preferably <span class="fa fa-arrow-right"></span> for the horizontal axis and <span class="fa fa-arrow-up"></span>
					    for the vertical axis.
					</p>
				    </li>
				    <li>
					<p>
					    Each axis must be clearly and correctly labelled with the quantity and the appropriate unit where applicable. The unit for each quantity must be in brackets
					    and should be at the same level except for the degrees. E.g. m(kg). The degrees should be written slightly above the level of the quantity e.g. i(<sup>0</sup>).
					</p>
				    </li>
				    <li>
					The axes <b>must not</b> be drawn using broken lines.
				    </li>
				    <li>
					<p>
					    Each axis must be marked after every 10 small divisions (2cm intervals) starting from the origin.<br/>
					    it is important to note that the graph may not necessarily start from the origin (0,0).<br/>
					    When drawing the axes, select a suitable position on the graph paper and draw the axes so as to cover all the values (Positive and Negative values if present) in your
					    Table of results.
					</p>
				    </li>
				    <li>The starting points on both axes must be clearly indicated for proper interpretation of the graph.</li>
				    <li>
					<p>
					    Note that, for a graph to be valid, it must cover at least three quarters of the graph paper. The graph must not be too small as this would bring about congestion of
					    the plotted points. To make this possible, you are advised to leave about two centimeters on all the sides of the graph paper such that the axes are drawn away from the ends of
					    the graph paper but not so much in the center of the graph paper.
					</p>
				    </li>
				    <li>
					The axis takes the name of the quantity that it holds. E.g if the axis holds M(kg), then it is called the <b>M-axis</b>.
				    </li>
				</ul>

		<div>
		    <h3 id="intercept">3. Intercepts</h3>
		    <div>
			<p>
			    The intercept on any axis is the value of the quantity plotted along that axis for which the value of the quantity along the other axis is zero (0).
			</p>
			<nums>
			    <ul>
				Note the following;
				<li>If the intercept is required from the vertical axis (y-axis), the starting point of the vertical axis can be any value <b>BUT</b> the starting point for the
				    Horizontal axis must be at Zero.</li>
				<li>
				    If the intercept is required from the Horizontal axis, the starting point for the horizontal axis can be any value <b>BUT</b> the
				    starting point for the vertical axis must be Zero.
				</li>
				<li>
				    If the intercept is require from both of the axes, then both of the axes must start from Zero as their Origins.
				    This means that Two intercepts e.g C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> are to be determined.
				</li>
				<li>
				    When determining the intercept, clearly indicate the point where the intercept is. This is where the line of best fit meets the axis from which the intercept is
				    required.
				</li>
				<li>
				    The number of significant figures for the intercept must be the number of Significant figures of the leading value from that column on that axis. E.g,
				    if the first value in the column represented on the axis has 3 significant figures, then the intercept must also have 3 significant figures.
				</li>
				<li>
				    If only the slope is required, and there are no intercepts asked for, it may not be necessary for the axes to start from zero especially
				    where it is found inconvenient.

		    <h3 id="scale">4. Scale</h3>
		    <p>
			The scale chosen to be used must be;
		    </p>
		    <nums>
			<ul>
			    <li>Suitable i.e covers at least 75% of the graph paper on both axes.</li>
			    <li>Convenient i.e. should be easy to use without any auxiliary calculations.</li>
			    <li>Uniform on boh of the axes.</li>
			    <li>Easy to interpret and follow</li>
			    <li>able to accommodate all the values in the column of the Table of results</li>
			</ul>
		    </nums>
		    <p>
			Starting points of the of each scale must be indicated clearly and the points where the scale is indicated on the axes must be written clearly
			for easy interpretation. Avoid crossings and Untidy work on the Axes.
		    </p>
		    <hr/>
		    <h4 id="obtaining_convenient_scale">How to obtain a Convenient Scale.</h4>
		    <p>
			A convenient scale is one that can easily be used by the Person plotting to indicate the values and By the person marking to read the values.
			The following ways can guide you in determining the convenient scale to use for any type of Graph;
		    </p>
		    <nums>
			<ul>
			    <li>
				Note the Maximum and minimum values from the columns to be plotted against each other.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Increase the maximum value by a small value and reduce the minimum by a small value. <br/>
				This helps in widening the range to be used while plotting on the graph and it helps you to use more space on the graph paper.
				<br/>
				<b>If an intercept was requested on any of the Axes, then decrease the minimum value for the other axis to an New minimum of Zero.</b>
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Determine the range between the New Maximum value and the New Minimum values for both of the axes.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				For the vertical scale, you are advised to use about 20cm, that is 100 small squares or division on the vertical axis. Therefore,
				divide the range for the vertical axis by 100<br/>
				For the Horizontal scale, you are advised to use  16 cm, that is about 80 small squares or divisions on the Horizontal axis. Therefore,
				divide the range for the Horizontal axis by 80.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				The figure values obtained in (4.) above represent what each small square represents on the Vertical and Horizontal axes respectively.<br/><br/>
				For convenience, we use scales involving digits <b> 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10,</b> their multiples or their sub-multiples such as
				<b>0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 0.10 or 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 100, etc...</b>
			    </li>
			    <li>
				If the figure value obtained in (4.) falls on one of the convenient scales like the ones in (5.), then use it.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				If the figure value obtained in (4.) does not fall on one of the convenient scales, then, take the nearest upper value from the set of the convenient scales. E.g.
				<br/><b>If the figure values obtained is 0.043, take 0.05, if the value obtained is 3.2, take 4, if the value obtained is 0.008356, take 0.01, etc...</b>
				The value chosen is what one(1) small square or division represent on the particular axis.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Multiply the figure value chosen or obtained from (4.) by 10 to obtain what 2cm (10 small squares) will represent.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				Indicate the scale values on the axes starting from the <b>New Minimum</b> as the origin and adding the value obtained for 2cm (in (8.) above)
				using an interval of 2cm (10 small squares).
			    </li>
			    <li>
				If the scale used leave out some values, use another greater scale from the convenient scale values, e.g. if the scale of 0.01 fails,
				use 0.02, or 0.02 fails, use 0.04 or 0.04 fails, use 0.05, e.t.c ...
			    </li>
			    <h5>NOTE;</h5>
			    <p>
				It is important to note that the scale involving digits 4 and 8 are not so much convenient though sometimes we use them.<br/>
				In cases where the scale obtained involves 4 as the only significant figure e.g. in 0.04, replace 4 with 5 and use 0.05. This is much more convenient that 0.04.<br/><br/>
				in case where the scale obtained involves 8 as the only significant figure, use 10, e.g if the scale obtained is 0.008, use 0.010. This is more convenient than 0.008.

			    Before determining the units for the final Quantity, know the quantity you are supposed to determine
			    . This is usually stated in the Aim of the Experiment.
			    If the quantity you are determining is a known quantity clearly defined in the aim of the experiment
			    e.g. acceleration due to gravity, g, the mass M of a Metre rule, internal resistance of a dry cell, etc...
			    <b>Then the units must be the SI Unit of the quantity.</b>
			    If the quantity you are determining is an unknown constant (a constant with unknown unit), then
			    the unit for this constant must be derived from the given formula.
			    It is therefore important to read and understand the Aim of the experiment before starting to work with the apparatus. This
			    helps you to know the quantity you are supposed to determine.

				    To determine the number of significant figures for the final value of the slope, we consider the number of significant
				    figures for the leading values in the columns for the Quantities plotted.
				    The slope should then be written to the least number of significant figures determined by comparing the significant figures
				    of the leading values from the table of results.
				    For instance, if the leading value in the column for the Y values has 3 s.f, and the leading value in the column for X
				    has 2 s.f, then, the final value for the slope should be written to 2 s.f. This is because, a slope is a ratio and ratios are divisions,
				    and the laws governing the significant figures for division, state that the final answer should always be written to the
				    least number of significant figures.<br/>

				    <b>NOTE:</b>
				    Never and Never forget the units unless the value determined has it's units canceling.
